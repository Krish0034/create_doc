# create_project

A new Flutter project.

## AUTHENTICATION MODUL:

I've developed an authentication module for a Flutter project using Firebase Authentication. Firebase Authentication provides a robust set of tools for authenticating users, including email authentication, phone authentication, and social authentication through providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. Here's a breakdown of the components I've implemented:

- **Email Authentication**: This allows users to sign up and log in using their email address and a password. Firebase handles the backend processes, including user creation, password hashing, and authentication.
- **Phone Authentication**: With phone authentication, users can sign up or log in using their phone number. Firebase sends a verification code to the user's phone, which they must enter to authenticate.
- **Social Authentication**: Firebase supports authentication via various social media platforms. Users can sign in using their existing accounts on services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc. Firebase manages the OAuth flow and token exchange behind the scenes.

Implementing these authentication methods in a Flutter project involves integrating Firebase Authentication SDK into your app and setting up the necessary configurations on the Firebase console. You'll also need to handle the UI for user sign-up, login, password reset, and error handling
